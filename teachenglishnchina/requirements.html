   <h4>what are the requirements to teach English in china?</h4>
     <p>Once you start thinking about teaching in China, you want to find out what candidates get the best teaching jobs in the country.</p>
     <p>To learn this, you need to be aware of the requirements to teach English in China. While education, age, international certificates, and citizenship are among the most important criteria, there are more details you want to know.</p>
      <p>Keep reading our article to find up-to-date English teacher requirements.

        Actually, there are some general requirements for ESL teacher applicants on the governmental level.

        However, each province and even school can change common requirements the way they need.

        The thing is that learning English in China is becoming more and more popular.

        Thus, English classes are in demand everywhere across China – from the largest metropolises to the smallest province towns.</p>
        <p>Taking into account the fact that the most qualified English native teachers prefer tier-1 cities over other possible places, small towns often lack ESL teachers.

            So, they can lower their requirements in order to interest a teacher who can’t find a job in a metropolis.

            Thus, if your education or qualifications don’t meet general requirements, it doesn’t mean you can’t teach in China.</p>
            <img src="vsa.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
            <h5>Education</h5>
        <p>You won’t be surprised if we say you must be an educated person to teach English in China, will you? Having a degree is one of the most important teaching English in China requirements.

            The Chinese government demands applicants for teaching jobs in China to be university graduates, and there are several reasons for it, for example:</p>
        <ul id="list">
            <li>If you’re going to work in China legally, you need to get a Z visa. And one of the requirements for obtaining this type of visa is having a bachelor’s degree.</li>
            <li>Applicants for teaching positions need to have a document that proves they have higher education on the governmental level.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Teaching certification (TEFL/TESOL/TOEFL etc.)</h5>
        <p>Providing a teaching certificate to your school is one of the main requirements to teach English in China.

            There are several certificates that give you the right to teach in China. Let’s have a look at the most popular ones.</p>
        <p>As a rule, TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) is in demand most of all. Chinese schools usually ask for a 120-hour certificate that is enough to become a confident English teacher.</p>
        <p>We’d like to mention though, that there are two types of TEFL programs – face-to-face and online.

            You want to be careful here since not all schools are willing to accept online certificates.

            That’s why it’s crucial to find out in advance whether your employer in China acknowledges certificates that were obtained online.</p>
        <p>Anyway, obtaining the TEFL certificate is a great advantage for ESL teachers in general as it gives an opportunity to teach English to non-native speakers all over the world.</p>
          <ul id="list">
              <li>TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) is the second popular certificate that can prove your qualifications for teaching English. Although TEFL and TESOL are quite similar exams, there’s a slight difference. With the TESOL certificate, you can teach English in both non-English speaking countries and English-speaking ones.</li>
              <li>CELTA (Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) is a certificate issued by the Cambridge University. It proves you have all the necessary skills to teach English as a second language.</li>
              <li>TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) is an exam that is valid in more than 130 countries of the world and proves your adequate ability to use and understand English.
                This exam is usually needed if you’re going to study or work abroad. Although TOEFL isn’t a test that determines your professional teaching skills, it might be enough for some educational institutions.</li>
          </ul>
         <h5>Citizenship Requirements</h5>
        <p>Speaking about ESL teaching requirements for applicants eager to work in China, citizenship ones are of great importance.

            Chinese schools and English language courses are willing their teachers to be natives. But why is it so?

            There are thousands of non-native teachers all over the world who have great teaching experience and hundreds of satisfied students.

            They help their students become confident English speakers.

            Some of them prepare their students to international exams, let alone entrance examinations for local universities…

            Still, natives are in more demand.

            So, what are the advantages of native teachers over those whose mother tongue isn’t English?

            The thing is that a native speaker can not only teach you how to use grammar and vocabulary.

            He/she can help you sound like English. Admit it, even the most talented non-native ESL teacher will have a slight accent.

            Moreover, natives can share a lot of cultural experience and broaden the horizons of Chinese (and not only Chinese) students.

            Thus, Chinese educational institutions prefer the UK, USA, Canada, Ireland, Australia, South Africa or New Zealand citizens over other candidates.

            But again, taking into account the fact that English teachers are in demand all year round, many employers can consider applicants from other countries.

            We have prepared step-by-step guides for native speakers on how to get a work Z visa to teach English in China, feel free to check them and learn how it works:

            UK, Canada, Autralia, USA, New Zealand, </p>
