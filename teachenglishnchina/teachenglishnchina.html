                  <h6 class="display-4">Do you wanna live and Earn Money in china?</h6>
                  <p class="lead">If the answer is YES. the best way to do that is working as an English teacher</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <h4>Reasons to work and live in china 2020.</h4>
              <p>China might seem an unrealistic option for some people, but in fact, it&rsquo;s so the opposite!

                China welcomes to teach English &ndash; native or non-native ones &ndash; as the language is constantly in high demand: more than 390 million people here are learning or have learned it before.</p>
                <img src="images/joy.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><h5>Great way to save money</h5>
                 <p>Isn&rsquo;t it the first thing you think about? Don&rsquo;t worry, the pay is adequate and will get you comfortable living and let you save for a rainy day.</p>
                 <p>Depending on your experience and the level of your language and professional skills, you can count on a salary from $1,500 to $2,400 plus extras like free accommodation and a contract completion bonus.</p>
                 <p>The sum may not seem impressive at first, but your level of life will be far above which makes it one of the best paid international teaching jobs.</p>
                 <p>Bear in mind, that your school will pay bills, so, technically, the only thing you&rsquo;ll have to pay for is food. Not bad!</p>
                 <p>The flight ticket and travel expenses will be also covered by the school.</p>
                 <p>Another good news: national holidays will give you a few paid weeks off. </p>
                <h5>Low cost of living</h5>
                <p>Actually, our clients say, you should try really hard to spend all your monthly salary and not put something by.</p>
                <p>Living here is a lot cheaper than in Europe or North America, especially if you are ready to eat national dishes instead of Western food.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll spend a lot in local restaurants, because Western cuisine is way more expensive here.</p>
                <p>A Chinese vacancy for English teachers will get you a high standard of life here, since $1000 in Asia can buy more, than anywhere else.</p>
                <p>In fact, to imagine how much you could afford in China, you have to triple the sum.

                    Now you see, that you can easily put by up to 50% or even 80% of your wages, which is a common practice among foreign teachers.

                    With $1,500 alone you could rent a comfortable apartment in the center of Shanghai or Beijing, eat out every day and still save for traveling or other things, isn&rsquo;t it amazing?</p>
               <h5>Useful for your CV</h5>
               <p>Especially if you are planning to continue in this field, having professional experience in China will help a lot:</p>
               <ul id="list"><li>work experience abroad.</li>
                   <li>work with international students, where you create an English-speaking environment in the class.</li>
                   <li>learn how to deal with specific difficulties, Asian students have in English.</li>
                   <li>get new skills and practice different approaches.</li>
                   <li>possibly learn Chinese.</li>
               </ul><p>Everyone knows, that international experience is priceless: all well-paid teaching jobs are usually offered to those, who have it, because working abroad mobilizes your knowledge, lets you learn fast and cope with unexpected situations better.

                All this is vital for an ESL specialist, so China is a place where you can both earn good money and get valued experience to make the CV more attractive.

                If this experience is to be the very first one, then it&rsquo;s your chance to learn a new profession, get certified to teach English to foreigners and get a decent job straight away!</p>

                <h5>Travel around China and abroad.</h5>
                <p>Those, who are eager to discover the ancient culture of the country, see new places, visit the Great Wall of China, learn things and meet people, will easily satisfy their cultural hunger.</p><p>

                    China is one of the best places to teach internationally not only because of the pay and cost of living but because of its diverse culture and beautiful traditions.

                    Its natural heritage is amazing too: imagine the vast Gobi desert, endless Inner Mongolia grasslands, and the famous Tiger Leaping Gorge!

                    Other parts of Asia are also easily accessible from big Chinese cities: Seoul is only 1 hour away from Beijing, a flight to Tokyo will take 3 hours, and 5 hours to Singapore&hellip;

                    Are you ready for the adventure?</p>
